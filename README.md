Custom configuration files for
- Alias
- Bash
- Fish
- Vim

**Note**: For `stow` remember to use the same folder structure the destination files would be.
E.g. `config.fish` should be place in `~/.config/fish/`, thus this same folder structure is used in the repo.  
TODO: major updates, keep updating this. Migrated from Fish to Zsh
