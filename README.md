Custom configuration files for
- alias
- bash
- fish
- nvim (neovim 5.0 is needed)
- git
- stow
- ssh
- alacritty
- tmux

Clone into `~/.dotfiles`

**Note**: For `stow` remember to use the same folder structure the destination files would be.
E.g. `config.fish` should be place in `~/.config/fish/`, thus this same folder structure is used in the repo.

For aliases in fish, copy them into `config/fish`
