Custom configuration files for
- alias
- bash
- fish
- vim
- git
- stow
- ssh

**Note**: For `stow` remember to use the same folder structure the destination files would be.
E.g. `config.fish` should be place in `~/.config/fish/`, thus this same folder structure is used in the repo.  
202002522: keep doing some polishing here and there, need to have a set up specific for servers too  

For aliases in fish, copy them into `config` in fish
